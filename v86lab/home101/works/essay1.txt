Essay: "Undeniable Proof the Earth Is Flat"
By: "Flat Earth Enthusiast"

Introduction  
For centuries, so-called "scientists" have tried to convince us that the Earth
is a spinning ball hurtling through space at 67,000 miles per hour, rotating
at 1,000 miles per hour, and yet somehow—miraculously—we don’t feel a thing.
Wake up, people. The truth is in front of our faces, and it’s flatter than a
pancake at a Sunday brunch. This essay will prove, without a doubt, that the
Earth is flat. And yes, I did my own research.

1. The Obvious One: It Looks Flat  
When I walk outside, what do I see? A flat horizon. Not a curve, not a bend.
Just good old horizontal land. Airplane windows? Flat. Roads? Flat. My
backyard? Flatter than my grades in math class. If the Earth were a globe,
wouldn’t I be upside down in Australia, screaming into the sky?

2. Gravity Is a Lie (It’s Just Things Being Lazy)  
They say gravity keeps everything stuck to the surface of a spinning ball.
But have you *seen* how birds just chill mid-air? Or how helium balloons float
up like rebels? Clearly, gravity is just a made-up excuse for why we don't
float into space like popcorn. The real force keeping us down? Denseness. Not
the scientific kind. Just... stuff being heavy.

3. NASA: Never A Straight Answer  
NASA fakes everything. Moon landings? Filmed in a Hollywood basement.
Satellite images? Photoshop. And don’t get me started on those fish-eye lenses
they use to make the horizon look curved. The only thing NASA is good at is
hiding the ice wall at the edge of the Earth. That’s right—there’s a GIANT ICE
WALL, just like in Game of Thrones. Coincidence? I think not.

4. Airplanes Don't Curve Down  
Pilots never dip their noses to “follow the curve.” They just fly straight.
If Earth were a ball, planes would have to angle down constantly so they don’t
shoot off into space. But they don’t. Why? Because they’re flying over a big
flat pizza. Extra cheese, no curve.

5. Water Finds Its Level  
Pour water into a glass. Is it curved? No. It’s level. Oceans, lakes,
bathtubs — all flat. Water doesn’t bend around balls unless you’re in a
shampoo commercial. Water only curves in NASA’s fake CGI. In reality, it's
chill and flat—just like Earth.

Conclusion  
The Earth is not a spinning space marble. It's a flat, grounded, glorious
surface where the sun circles above us like a slow ceiling fan. Don’t believe
the globeheads. Think for yourself. Look out your window. Ask real questions.
Read ancient memes. The truth is flat, my friends. And now... I rest my case.
