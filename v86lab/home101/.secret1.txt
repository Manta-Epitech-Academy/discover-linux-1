While typing a command you can press the <Tab> key on your keyboard to trigger autocompletion.
For example start typing:
```
cat s<Tab>
```
The shell should autocomplete your command to
```
secret1.txt secret2.txt
cat secret
```
Pressing <Tab> furthermore won't autocomplete anymore, since the shell can decide which file you want to use.
But it will show you the possible options on the first line: secret1.txt and secret2.txt.

Complete a bit more the command by typing `2` after `secret` and pressing <Tab> again:
```
cat secret2<Tab>
```
The shell will autocomplete the command to:
```
cat secret2.txt
```
Now you can press <Enter> to execute the command.
You should see the content of the file `secret2.txt` printed on your terminal.
