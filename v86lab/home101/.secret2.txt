If a file contain a lot of text, you can use the `less` command to view it page by page.
For example, to view the file `memo1.txt`, you can type:
```
less memo1.txt
```
You can navigate through the file using the arrow keys, quit by pressing `q`, and search for text by typing `/` followed by the text you want to find.
This is useful for reading long files without overwhelming your terminal with too much text at once.

The navigation keys in `less` work also in other commands like `man`.
